                <ul id="qualifications--list">
                    <li>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  While I was in highschool and throughout my first few years of college, I was one of the lead developers on a Roblox game called Murder Mystery 2. What started as a small indie project quickly snowballed into one of the flagship titles of the site. The project has seen continued success, amassing over 100k daily players, 20 million favorites, and over 20 BILLION hours of gameplay.<li>
                        <li>&nbsp;</li>
                        <li> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The project is a digital version of the popular campfire game Mafia, played by kids across America. The rules of the game are simple, players are assigned one of three roles; Innocent, Sheriff, or Murderer.<li>
                            <li>&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>Their goals are as follows</li>

                            <li>Sheriff - Protect the Innocents and Eliminate the Murderer</li>
                            <li>Innocent - Survive and help the Sheriff catch the Murderer</li>

                            <li>While I no longer have an active hand in the project, I was a lead developer and project manager for 3 years between 2018-2021. </li>
